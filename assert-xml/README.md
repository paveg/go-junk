## Construction

### Description

Defined XMLNode to be handled appropriately. `#parseXML` is broken down into three processes.

1. start xml node
  This detects the starting position of the xml tag. And for xmlNode, it keeps the tag name and tag, node nesting structure.
2. close xml node
  This detects the end position of the xml tag. Proceed the index.
3. text
  Get non-tag name text and record it for the currentNode.Text


### Modules

- main.go ... execution file
- parser ... extracted parser files, this includes xml parser that is created from scratch and its test file
  - xml.go
  - xml_test.go


## How to execute code
